## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- An active OpenWeatherMap API key

## How It Works
## User Input:
The user enters a city name in the search input field and submits the form.

## API Request:
The JavaScript function constructs a URL using the provided city name and API key, then fetches the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Data Processing:
The app converts the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius and extracts other key details such as humidity and wind speed.

## UI Update:
The weather data is dynamically inserted into the page, updating the main content area with weather details and relevant icons.

## Error Handling:
The application ensures that empty input values are not processed, and proper error handling is in place for the API fetch process.
